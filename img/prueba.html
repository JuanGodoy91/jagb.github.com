    <p class="">The arrow of the mouse. So, is there security? I may <i>depend for security</i>, psychologically, on my wife, on my husband. I depend. I am attached, and in that attachment, in that dependence, there is a certain form, subtle form of security. And also unconsciously there is the doubt that this security may not be real because you might go away tomorrow. So there is always doubt, there is always insecurity in the search of security personally, psychologically. Right? So we are asking - please this is very <a href="" style="cursor: wait;">cursor: url(redball.cur);</a>important to ask and find out - if you can live not with security but with intelligence, because that is the ultimate security, a man who is really intelligent. Then in that there is no fear whatsoever. So we have to enquire - by Jove, it is hot! - we have to enquire into what is intelligence.</p>
    <p><cite>"Staining the sudden blueness, the slow sounds,</cite>
    <cite>Deliriums that streak the glowing sky,</cite>
    <cite>Stronger than drink and the songs we sing,</cite>
    <cite>It is boiling, bitter, red; it is love!"</cite>
    <span class="author">* C. Baudelaire</span></p>
    <p class="">The word 'intelligence', from Latin and so on, is not only to read between the lines - you understand? - read between the lines. Supposing you receive a letter, in that letter everything is not expressed but you have to have a clear mind to read between the words, get the significance of it. That is part of that intelligence. And also intelligence means to gather a lot of information, a lot of knowledge, and act skilfully with that knowledge, that is partly intelligence. Right? If I am an engineer I gather knowledge all about engineering, the stresses and the strains, the mathematics and so on, so on, and according to that knowledge I act. So that is also part of knowledge. But all such knowledge is limited because it is based on knowledge. Are you following? As we pointed out the other day, knowledge is always limited. Right? And if you seek comfort, security in knowledge, you are seeking security in a very limited thing, therefore it will always create fear. Or if you have any kind of concept to which you hold, that also will cause fear. But if you see that any dependence, any attachment, any adherence to a belief, is not intelligent, then that very intelligence gives you security. Is this clear somewhat? Are we making this clear? No. All right.</p>
